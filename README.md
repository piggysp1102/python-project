# Analysis on Airbnb Shanghai
## brief description
In this project, I made a brief analysis on airbnb in Shanghai. File named airbnb-SH-listings.csv.zip is the database from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

In file 'airbnb-in-shanghai.py', the data is visualized as scatter plot using Geojsen

In another file 'plot', I created some plots analyzing the distribution of the housing locations, finding the relationship between popular housing and
the time they signed up in airbnb.

I also made a cloudword to explore the key words they most like to use (especially the popular hosts like to use) in the housing description.

You can review the plots in 'airbnb-review.html' file and wordcloud image.
